Homework 2 - due August 6

Setup:
    In Eclipse, import HW2.zip as an existing project. Here are the steps:

    0) Before performing the import, make sure your computer has internet access because Maven will download dependencies from Maven repo on the internet
    1) In Eclipse, select File->Import
    2) select General->Existing Projects into Workspace and click Next > button
    3) select "Select archive file" option and then click on the Browse button
    4) browse file system to the location of the zip file and select the zip file (it is not necessary to unzip the zip file to import)
    5) click on the Finish button

    Now you have a project called hadoop-student-homework in Eclipse.

    Source code already provided in the project:

    MovieCount.java - an example of how to count movies
    ConfigurationUtility.java - a utility for examining your configuration
    HomeworkDriver.java - a utility for running Hadoop jobs


Assignment: 
Write code to do the following

    Homework2 Part1: for each movie, show who are the actors
    Homework2 Part2: for each actor, show how many movies he/she has played in
    Bonus (extra credit 10 pts): for each actor, show the average weight of the movies he/she has played in.
        Bonus is optional, you do not need to do it to get full credit.  It is also much more challenging.
        Bonus uses two datasets:  data/movie/imdb.tsv and data/movie-weights.tsv

    What data do I use? check out the data/movie directory in the project


What to turn in:

Turn in the hadoop-student-homework-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

    Create the jar using Eclipse:
        1) Right-click on hadoop-student-homework project
        2) Select Run As -> Maven install
        3) The jar is in your target directory: hadoop-student-hadoop-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Turn in your java code for Homework2Part1 and Homework2Part2.  If you have it, also turn in your code for Bonus.

Turn in your data through the UCSC portal:  https://online.ucsc-extension.edu/xsl-portal/

Due date:  August 6, 2016 (yes, this year).
